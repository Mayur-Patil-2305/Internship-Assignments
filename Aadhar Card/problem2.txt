Problem Statement 2: Aadhar Card Management.

You have been given the responsibility to manage the data of a Aadhar like card.

Each entry has these mandatory fields:
Aadhar Id - [Unique, Random]
First Name - 
Guardian’s Name -
Last Name -

You should be able to do the following with the entries:
- Adding an entry
- Deleting an entry
- Updating an entry - (Not Aadhar Id)
- Searching an entry

Search by Id or Full name(The user enters their 'full name' or any substring, return all the entries that match [in First name, guardian’s name, last name] completely or partially)
- Blacklist entries/ Remove from Blacklist

Don’t allow users to access the entry, if the entry is blacklisted

Now, there is a telephone company which uses this data to give unique phone numbers to people with non blacklisted Aadhar Id’s.
Users provide the telephone company with their Aadhar Id & First Name.
Check the first name against the Aadhar Id in o(1) and return with yes or no.
If the entry is present, the telephone company allots a unique phone number to the recipient.
You could use console input or file input or any other means.

Try to use as many OOP concepts as you can.

Note:
Write a quick summary of the thought process how you decided to approach the problem.
- Have done something extra other than the problem? Please mention, we would love to know.
